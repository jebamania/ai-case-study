## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Narwal Robotics aims to solve real-world problems related to cleaning and household maintenance with its innovative products. Specifically, their self-cleaning robot mop and vacuum target the high-end consumer market, offering a solution to the time-consuming and labor-intensive task of floor cleaning. By automating the cleaning process, Narwal's robots provide convenience and efficiency to users, allowing them to maintain cleaner living spaces with minimal effort.

Furthermore, Narwal Robotics incorporates advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), in its solutions. The Narwal Freo robot vacuum cleaner features AI DirtSense technology, a first in the market, which enables the robot to identify areas with persistent stains and automatically re-mop those areas until the floor is clean. This AI-driven approach allows the robot to intelligently handle different types of stains and ensure thorough cleaning. Additionally, Narwal's robots utilize lidar technology for mapping spaces efficiently, offering a faster and more accurate mapping process compared to camera-based systems. While Narwal's robots may not have AI-based object detection for obstacles, they excel in leveraging AI for optimizing cleaning processes and enhancing user experience.
