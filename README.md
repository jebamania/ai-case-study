## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
While Narwal Robotics offers advanced features like AI DirtSense technology and LiDAR navigation, feedback from industry experts indicates a perceived lag in technological innovation compared to leading competitors. Addressing these shortcomings and focusing on continuous technological advancements could be crucial for Narwal to stay competitive and maintain its position in the evolving home floor cleaning robotics market. Quicker releases perhaps following an Agile approach to update their software could help address this.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
They have the edge right now, but keeping up with industry advancements is challenging. Leaders in tech seem to be catching on that their technology is falling behind, but it hasn't reached the consumer yet. They need to get ahead of that and start making rapid updates.
Another area would be to update the mop pads or related hardware to prevent the issue they are solving in the first place (to stop the robot from having to check if the floor is clean because it often doesn't get the floor clean in a single pass). Maybe it can look ahead and determine if it needs to run slower over a specific spot, or stop on a specific spot and just clean it for a moment.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
It actually utilizes the same technologies, it just involves keeping them up to date with the industry expectations / features.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
They are proven to work, it just comes down to how many times the robot has to run over a specific spot.
